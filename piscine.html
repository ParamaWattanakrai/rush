        <h3>THE FOUNDING OF 42 BANGKOK</h3>
        <P>42 Bangkok was founded by Prof. Dr. Suchatvee Suwansawat, President of King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL), Bangkok, Thailand. He was inspired to bring the 42 learning platform to Thailand when visiting Ecole 42 Paris, France in March 2019. This unique development model that focuses on computer programming knowledge by having students self educate themselves was found to be very effective. This program, developed by a leading French academic computer team, happened to be consistent with the policies of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation of Thailand; whose main goal is to create and develop Smart Citizens, providing equal opportunities for lifelong learning to people of all ages, ultimately driving innovative research and development to satisfy the country’s needs. Therefore, in collaboration with Ecole 42 Paris, 42 Bangkok was established as a new member of the 42 Network with 33 campuses around the world as well as being the first to exist in the ASEAN community. Established through a memorandum of understanding between the institute and Ecole 42 Paris, France on 15 November 2019.</P>
